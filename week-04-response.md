In 2016, <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/games/arbys-tweets-gaming-actually-kinda-cool/">Arby's launched a viral marketing campaign</a> where papercraft figures of various video game and anime properties were created using food packaging materials. The elaborate figures stood next to various Arby's menu items and typically coincided with the launch of a game or tv show. The images appeared on Arby's various social media platforms and went viral among gaming audiences. The shift of focus towards beloved fictional characters and away from the food subverted typical food imagery marketing. Co-branding a product in order to reach new audiences isn't a new concept, but Arby's focus on niche media properties such as video games and anime meant that typical Arby's fans would be confused by the ads.
