In 2016, <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/games/arbys-tweets-gaming-actually-kinda-cool/">Arby's launched a viral marketing campaign</a> where papercraft figures of various video game and anime characters were created using food packaging materials. The elaborately designed figures stood next to various Arby's menu items. The ads typically coincided with the launch of a new game or tv show. The images appeared on Arby's various social media platforms and went viral among gaming audiences. The shift of focus towards fictional characters and away from the food subverted typical food imagery marketing. Co-branding a product in order to reach new audiences isn't a new concept, but Arby's focus on niche media properties such as video games and anime meant that many other Arby's fans would be confused by the ads. The ads didn't explicitly state the name of the characters or the media franchises they came from. It was the ultimate "if you know, you know" nod to gamers.<br>

Looking at it more subjectively, we can try to see what Arby's intended with these ads and why social media might have been the only platform where these ads would work. Firstly, social media algorithms are designed to show content to users based on their interests. If Arby's targeted the content towards gamers, the likelihood of a relevant  impression was a lot higher than on platforms such as television. Arby's likely intended the ad to appeal to it's audiences in a way that would make people interact with it.<br><br>

In tying this to Barthes three messages, the linguistic message is usually a knowing but coy statement about the media property and how it relates to the Arby's brand that accompanies the images. But largely the images are devoid of text, playing to the idea of it's audience needing to be in the know to understand them. Which gets to the second message, the connotated message. Arby's wants their target audience to know that they are in tune with gamer and anime culture and that they believe their food belongs there as well. Lastly, the non-coded message is that this is food, and that gamers, just like anyone else, needs to eat. And if they can appeal to gamers by showing things they love alongside food they also love, they might get them to equate the two and make a purchase. The food isn't dressed up or subjected to unrealistic representation. The ad respects its audience and knows that they understand the reality of what fast food looks like. <br><br>

The campaign has been massive successful and continues run to this day, with the latest one appearing in January 2022. Arby's and their marketing team has successfully tied their brand to gaming culture through the use of imagery composed of papercraft and food products, despite the food products being deemphasized, and in some cases absent entirely. The images are made to go viral, and for gamers and anime fans to share them across their social media feeds. Posts containing these images have anywhere from 2x to 100x the engagement than a post not featuring one.
