<h1>The Audience as the Product</h1>

Murray rightly predicted many of the innovations we would see across the entertainment landscape as new technologies emerged. One of the key areas she predicted correctly was the audience being a live participant in the program. What she might not have predicted was the wide spread broadcasting of people's lives view platforms such as twitch.

Perhaps some of the loneliness created through technological silos and modern capitalist societies need streaming as a platform. Watching TV programs by ourself became an isolating activity. Murray knew that interacting with fellow fans in real time was going to be how people connected over their shared interests. "Communities" are just in their infancy. Bulletin boards of the Web 1.0 days gave way to the early social media companies as people flocked to the internet to find like minded fans. This has morphed to discord channels and subreddits. Mobile interactivity means that we never miss out on connecting with people when we want to.

But as the audience becomes part of the overall product, we start to feel the pressures of being "live" all the time. Every word we saw online is documented and can be dragged out of the abyss to haunt us, regardless of context. Our lives in these digital neighborhoods as Murray describes them are reliant on us keeping to the new norms of online behavior.  But who would've thought that a lonely person sitting in their parents attic playing video games would draw more daily viewers than most Hollywood produced, well marketed, tv shows?

The ways we interact with these communities will continue to evolve. If Meta were to be believed, we will all be digital avatars meeting in virtual environments within a few years. This dystopian vision, where we abandon our bodies in lieu of an avatar has been explored in media for decades. Immersion means a lot of different things when you consider the new digital frontier. Some people will be comfortable with all of their senses overridden by a digital environment while some people will immediately reel in discomfort when experiencing their avatar for the first time; almost like meeting a new version of yourself.
<br>
As the immersion deepens, the roles we play in this virtual worlds will also change. Rather than being lead through narrative experiences, we can take active roles in adapting these worlds to our ideas in real time. This was the idea behind the holodeck. Giving a system parameters to create a digital environment and then defining our role would build narratives that we can lose ourselves in. Star Trek, a prophetic show if there ever was one, predicted that holodeck addiction could be a real problem. In multiple episodes, the character lieutenant Barclay struggles with engaging in the routine of his real life because the experiences he crafted in the holodeck were so much more fulfilling. The show raises the ethical question of whether it's appropriate to create digital avatars of people from the real world so we can experience different kinds of relationships and emotions with them. There are multiple episodes dedicated to this idea because it is paramount as we move towards user generated content in digital worlds.
<br>
Murray had all the right ideas for where content was headed. One thing that was slightly off was the unified platform for interacting with content. There are two major groups of people who interact in this way: One group wants to be part of the mass, adding their voice to the chorus of like minded fans. The other group wants to build a small community of like minded people to share things with on a more personal level. But there is something for everyone, and that's exciting.
