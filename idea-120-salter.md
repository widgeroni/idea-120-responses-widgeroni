<h2>Punk Rock: The Dissolution of the Performer and Audience</h2><br>
<br>
Live musical performances as an experience have evolved alongside society. Ancient humans used music in ritual practices. As music became more complex and formal, so too did performances. The rift between performer and audience became wider and wider. There was a certain level of respect for the act of performing. Stages became common, serving to physically separate the crowd from the performer. This elevation was practical in the sense that the audience could have a better view, but also meant to serve as a metaphor: do not interrupt those on stage. <br><br>
But as rock and roll music evolved throughout the 20th century, so did the idea of what a rock performance could entail. Punk music ripped all conceptions of formality in a performance into a million pieces and then pissed on them. Punk was raw, visceral. It was meant to be experienced in a physical sense by not only the bands performing, but the audience as well. The antagonistic nature of punk rock gave rise to new types of crowd interactions; stage dives, head walks, mosh pits...these took the focus away from the musicians and put it on the raucous fans. <br><br>
These violent and destructive performances weren't meant for traditional venues, with the crowd being separate from the band. Punk found it's home <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQYkwRXc6UM">on the floor</a><// This is my old hardcore band, Expired Youth, performing in Kentucky in 2005 or 2006. I had just quit the band but was obligated to finish this tour. Me and the drummer were fighting the whole trip, and you can see my aggression coming through in the performance.

As a performer, you expect your guitars to get unplugged, the mic to be ripped away from you so the audience can take over, or a million other disruptions. A culture of collaboration and care exists in the best of these scenarios, with people being often times violently engaged in moshing until the moment someone falls down. The scramble to see everyone attempt to lift the person up and get them back in on the action is akin to watching a guitar tech whisk a new guitar on stage when a string is broken. They exist on the same spectrum of the performance. Adapting to these unpredictable events makes the shows exciting and instilled in them a sense of danger.
<br><br>
But like all things, Punk evolved as well. As these audience interactions became an expected part of the experience, bands capitalized on it. The Flaming Lips famously have a portion of their performance where singer Wayne Coyne enters a giant bubble and rolls out onto the audience. Taking this a step further, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j28LZbD_7A">at one performance</a>, the band had all audience members also enter inflatable bubbles to become part of the performance. The band Anti-Flag has recently concluded many of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvEYmRsivNU">live performances</a> by moving their drum set into the crowd, as bass player Chris #2 stands atop it, leading a claustrophobic throng in the final chorus of their song "Die for Your Government."<br><br>
<// You gotta die gotta die gotta die for your government, die for your country, that's shit! //>
This break down in formality utilizes the audience as a piece of the performance. It still faces challenges in full implementation due to modern contrivances like "liability" and "insurance" on behalf of the performers and venues, but the will to engage audiences in a more personal, physical, and emotional way is part of what makes the punk music live experience so appealing to youths. It eschews modern technologies to return humans to a more primitive state, where we can all offer something to a live experience without feeling like we're taking away from the performance. When you consider the idea of "total art", a performance the breaks down the setting, stage, and the relationships between performer and audience, you see a harmonious collaboration. The culture that exists around the music helps keep the guardrails on the performance without ever robbing it of the sense of wonder and danger that exists. Punk is still only a few decades old and will still evolve. Even the idea of what Punk entails is debatable in modern times. I would argue that as long as the element of interactivity exists, and that the audiences are just as much a part of the music and performance as the artists, that is Punk.
