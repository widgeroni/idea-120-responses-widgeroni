<h2>Accessibility - Beyond Controllers </h2>
<br><br>
The term accessibility spans a wide range of topics. In the US, physical accessibility has been mandated by the American's with Disabilities Act for around 30 years. The 
law was an attempt to make buildings and public spaces accessible to people with physical disabilities while also protecting them from discrimination. 

While this was a necessary step in addressing the inequity that people with disabilities faced, it was limited in scope. The way people with various types of disabilities
experience the world is varied. Emotional disabilities are often times completely overlooked. 
<br>
When looking at accessibility, there are a few categories worth discussing.
<br>
1. Physical Experiences<br>
2. Psychological Experiences<br>
3. Neurological Experiences<br>
4. The Equity of Experience<br>

Physical experiences are centered around physical interactivity. With video games, this often comes in the form of the input device. This could be a controller,
mouse and keyboard, motion controller, VR headset, or even your body. Each of these  create experiences that rely on the user interacting with something in the physical
world. Often times people with physical disabilities have trouble interacting with input devices. Other people with neurological issues (like being sensitive to touch) 
might struggle with having to hold a physical object for long periods of time. Microsoft recognized the potential create more accessible ways to interact with video games 
and created the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller">xbox adaptive controller</a>. This flexible device, made with the 
input from users with multiple forms of physical imparements, was able to address a growing market of users who wanted to engage in interactive entertainment but were not able to
use traditional input devices. Microsoft priced the controller reasonably, only being about 50% more than a traditional controller. While this doesn't solve all the
issues associated with physical experiences, it shows that with there is a lot of room to expand how we think about interactivity. <br>

The second point, psychological experiences, is a wider category for accessibility. Audiences looking to engage with interactive media come from a wide range of backgrounds, 
cultures, and experiences. Previous psychological trauma can be trigged by engaging with media and when it is unexpected or unwanted, it can create a potential harmful experience.
Game designers have listened to a lot of this feedback over the last decade and started to incorporate warnings into their games. While games have been subjected to 
generic ratings for content for well over two decades, this doesn't account for all the types of content that could be harmful to people. Designers now are responding
to the triggers that their audiences have identified and in some ways have allowed players to skip entire segments of games in order to bypass potentially harmful
interactions.<br>

Neurological experiences are starting to be more recognized by designers. While some of us might want bombastic action games, there are other people who need interactive
game experiences that are designed to work with their neurological conditions. This could be a game designed to help someone with a short attention span feel engaged
or someone that has trouble communicating interact with an environment that makes them feel understood.<br>

Lastly is the equity of experiences. Microsoft priced their adaptive controller at $99, which is only 30-40% more than a traditional controller. While there are clearly
costs associated with the design and production of the controller, that it costs 30-40% more than a traditional controller means that gamers who require additional
accessibility accommodating are paying a higher price for their entertainment. That being said, Microsoft absolutely could have gone the opposite direction and labeled
the device as a niche product for a small audience. At its current price point it still remains accessible to most game enthusiasts, and has set the bar for price
for their potential competitors. Beyond physical equity, is the experiential equity. Gamers who enjoy narrative style games should be able to tailor their game experience
in a way that doesn't cause harm to their mental health. Forcing players to engage in acts that could cause or trigger psychological trauma should be clearly labeled
and skippable if not required for the narrative. <br>

Accessibility is such a broad topic and is just really being incorporated to all kinds of interactive experiences. I'm always reminded of a phrase commonly used by 
the disability community: "Nothing for us without us." Designers should always be listening to their audiences in order to create the best experiences possible. Not every
game or interactive media will be for everyone, but understanding how to let people know that ahead of time and letting them decide will build a lot of good will.
