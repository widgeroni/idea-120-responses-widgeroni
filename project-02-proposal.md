<h1>Surreal Dream Scape</h1>
<br>
<br>
As our world becomes more digital and more of our interactions move to virtual spaces, it's easy for reality to feel more surreal. We glimpse into the curated backdrops of each others lives. But what if we started to view each others dreams instead of their realities?
<br>
One of my favorite movies is Paprika by Satoshi Kon. The blending of reality and dreamscapes creates a disorienting effect on the viewer. One is never quite certain if what they are seeing is real or not. I would like to create a backdrop that appears to be real, but slowly reveals itself to be something much more fantastical, like a dream. Objects might move or be replaced with things that seem out of place. Slowly, one would start to question if what they are seeing is a dream.

<br>Over the course of a few minutes, I would be reading about somnambulating. The topic would give a clue to what the viewer was witnessing, without overtly stating what is happening. I believe I could achieve the technique by recording from my webcam various dream like background scenes, and stitching them together. Then I would record myself in the same position talking. It would give the scene a dream like feel with multiple things happening, sometimes overlapping in non-linear ways. For example, I could show myself coming into the frame in the background, while also speaking.

The overall theme would be to create a familiar scene (someone one a zoom call) and imbue it with a subtle surreal undertone.
