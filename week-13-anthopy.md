<h1>Are rules necessary for a game?</h1>
<br><br>
Anna Anthopy covers a few interesting concepts in these chapters of their book. A few questions I came up with hare:
<br><Br>
How have "rules" changed over time in digital formats? For example, many early rules for games were based on driving revenue from arcade machines so having a clear "lose"
state created a point in which players would need to invest more money to continue the game. Now lose states are viewed differently and often only reset progression. But
why is that even necessary? The only thing the player loses is time, which often is frustrating more than entertaining. 

<br><br>
  What would happen if the rules of a game had their own goals and desires rather than forcing players into a lose state? Adaptive difficulty and other methods of 
  scaling have been implemented in games to help the player, but what if the underlying systems acted much more like a traditional dungeon master and could break
  the rules whenever they saw fit to create a more interesting play experience? 
  
<br><br>
Anthopy defines a game as "an experience created by rules." but I think broadly, this isn't a requirement of a game. The first time I was introduced to this concept
was in the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip. The main character, Calvin, invents a game to play with his imaginary tiger friend, Hobbes. The resulting game, Calvinball, is confusing
and ever changing because there are no rules. It's adaptable to the situation and the whims of the players, focusing on, as Anthopy also highlights as a defining feature of a game, the interaction of the players. This concept has evolved into the sandbox genre of games.
Minecraft and Robolox emulate the freeform nature of the school playground, where participants can engage with a game in a way that makes sense to the player rather
than the creator of the game. In sandbox games, the only rules are those enforced by the physical limitations of the play environment, and even those are fairly loose. Sandbox
  games give players unprecedented freedom to explore their creativity in virtual environments without being saddled with the game makers expectations. Dreams, released
  for the playstation, is a combination of sandbox and game making toolkit where players can experiment with an endless possibilities of creating and experiencing digital
  experiences. Being able to creatively adapt the rules of a game can give it longevity and create unique experiences that traditional developers might struggle with when
  attempting to make a commercially successful project that focuses on narrative or competitive gameplay.
