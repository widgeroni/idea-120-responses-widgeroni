<h1>No One Cares on the Internet</h1>

In Lisa Nakamura's book, she meticulously sets the stage for how identity, race, and socio-economic factors influence new-media art and how we as consumers interact with it.
By framing it in the lens of 90's neo-liberalism, we might believe that offline prejudices and unconcious biases are less relevant when engaging with online media. When the
page we are looking at in our browser lacks any racial or gendered information, we can assign any value to the creator we want. As much of our communication and engagement
moves to online formats, we could naively believe that our biases no longer exist. But this robs us of context in our digital communications. Being able to understand intent
is a large part of consuming any media content, whether it be entertainment, communication, or informative.

Nakamura quotes Lev Manovich when trying to articulate how we must understand a creator when engaging with their media, asking us to "identify with their mental structure." As
online media transitions to more personally produced content, such as YouTube videos and TikToks, the need to identify and understand creators grows. We bring our own biases
into the engagement, and whether we want it or not, alogrithms pick up on these as we interact with content. These biases will influence how we perceive content creators, and will
often times preclude us from being able to identify with them in an authentic way. While we might be able to get deeper looks into the personal lives of media creators,
it's easier to dismiss the struggles they face and the perspectives they convey because our interactions with online content is far less personal.

But this is a two way street. Content creators are continually pressured to create personal and meaningful experiences for their audiences. Twitch streamers thrive when they can
build a community that feels seen and engaged with. It is very easy for these types of interactions to feel forced and inauthentic, and just a tool for streamers to generate 
attention and revenue. In that way, streamers are creating personas merely to sell a product, with the thin vaneer or giving their audience a look into their private mindset.

 What this creates is a feedback loop between content creator and audience, where the audience disengages from the creator, because they are always suspecting their intentions.
  The creator likewise establishes their identity based on what their community wants. If the depersonalization of content, while being sold as intimate engagement, continues
  the antagonistic nature of creator and audience will only grow deeper. It's hard to define what an authentic online experience is anymore, with so much of the internet being
  drive by commerce, but there are still many people who hope to find their own voice in online content creation. Hopefully some of the reticence of the internet media consumer
  will be alleviated as they identify with the mental structures of creators.
