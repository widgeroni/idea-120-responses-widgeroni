I've worked on both sides of the predatory online advertising world. Right after high school I worked at an online payday loan processing company. Desperate people would send every piece of confidential financial and personal data to a fax number and we would review it. Most people were in desperate situations, where $100 meant feeding their kids for the week. After working through a holiday season, and hearing pleas from customers to not ruin their families Christmas, I couldn't take it anymore and I quit.

The next job I had after that was with a tech start up that did both SEO and affiliate marketing. A number of the companies in the article were our clients. Finding out how the internet worked made me a lot more cautious of online advertisers. There were some truly good things happening, where companies were trying to partner customers with the best deal available, but more often the goal was the driver higher interaction and conversion rates. The company published a ground breaking white paper about consumer search behavior and how online interactions lead to in person purchases, which no one was tracking at that point.

Predatory ads are not going away. But just as culpable are the ad serving platforms in which these companies can target these types of customers. Google and Facebook are aware that these types of businesses are targeting customers who are vulnerable. There have been moves to tag ads more clearly, but most people don't know why they are seeing ads. We don't want to reflect on the decisions that we've made online and offline in order to build our advertising profile. But understanding our own situations and vulnerabilities will help us stay away from ads for deceptive products.
