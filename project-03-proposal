<h1>The McGuffin of Power</h1>

<br>

Many fantasy stories involve a hero finding a fabled weapon to destroy some world threatening evil. While many of these objects of power have fabled histories
(such as the one ring from Lord of the Rings or Excalibur from King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table), we never hear stories from the perspective of the
object itself. I would like to create a story about an object of power that is continually sought after when it's needed but is otherwise abandoned in some 
ancient locale, lonely and wishing it had a purpose and life other than just being called on when the world needs saving.

The narrative could branch into a "Brave Little Toaster" like tale, where the object of power and its entorouge of other mystically imbued objects search for purpose
and meaning, creating friendships, enduring hardships, and even facing off against evils. Through the tale they will find that their existence means more than just
being exploited when the world is in danger and that they can decide a destiny for themselves.
